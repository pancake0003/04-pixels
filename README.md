my experience with the exercise:
I think this exercise is very insightful because I've always liked analyzing other people's code, and this exercise is just right for me! I really love the different ways different people approach a problem, and it makes me think what I would've done differenly if it were me. This exercise keeps me active and thinking about code. 

OpenProcessing explorations:
I really love many projects on OpenProcessing. Although they're all small and cute projects, each are unique and very well-designed. I love Can Crusher and Gaussian Blur and a lot of other minigames and shaders. I love the 3D models and the shaders as well. 

I also found the format of JavaScript very interesting (interestingly disgusting), as it's a little different in structure from Java, but also disgustingly similar to Java. :')
